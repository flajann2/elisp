* Emacs Extensions
** Synopsis
   Basically, I want to develop extensions for my favorite editing tool, and
   so this is it. All is avaiable on the MELPA repo.

** Acknowledgements
   Some of what we have here are forks from other projects, and others
   will be my own original works (I don't have any yet!) In each
   extension, the appropriate acknowledgements are given.
